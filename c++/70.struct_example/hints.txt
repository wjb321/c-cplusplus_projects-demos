1. rand() and srand
2. struct array
3. struct as input of a function

1. rand()/srand(): produce a value in range 0~ max_num, everytime it run, the value is going to be the same
           so here has to use seed: srand(): srand(1), which means:
		   srand(i);
		   int number = rand(); //when i is changed, then number value will be changed when run the code differently, so 
		   // using time can be as the input.
		   so:  
		   srand((unsigned int)time(NULL));
		   int number = rand();

		   but if i want the rand value in 0~100 ?
		   int rd = rand();
		   x = (rd * 100) / RAND_MAX; // range will be in [0, 100]
2. struct:
   inside struct, there is still another struct, how to access the inside struct?
   pointer: ->
   value: .
   struct as the input of function parameter, when call the function, can simply use the array name if it is a struct array
   a. function define:
   void printinfo(struct Teacher tArray[], int len)
   b. call the function:
   allocateSpace(tArray, len);
3. string can use += to add new string behind
